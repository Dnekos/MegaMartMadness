# MegaMartMadness
This is an unfinished project done with 7 of my peers over the summer. It is a 1-4 player local competetive game where each player much score points over three rounds by picking up and checking out various items. Players can pick up power ups to get an edge over their opponents, including a speed boost, an extending arm to steal items, and a shield to protect yourself. Controls are slippery and tank based to replicate the movement of a shopping cart.Multiple control schemes are functional, including keyboard and controller. If playing with less than four people, opponents will be played by AI powered by the Astar pathfinding algorithm.
